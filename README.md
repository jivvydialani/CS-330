### 1. How do I approach designing software?
  * #### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    The design skills I learned in this course helped me create create a 3D scene out of a 2D image. I am able to mimic objects using different primitive shapes. I created complex objects using a combination of primitive shapes. I learned how to manipulate the lighting of my scene to create a more realistic and immersive experience. I also learned that using textures properly can help visually trick the viewer into seeing different depths.
    
  * #### What design process did you follow for your project work?
    Understanding how different primitive shapes can form an object was key in helping me design my work. After that, it was incremetally creating the world one object at a time, one lighting source at a time, and one texture at a time.
    
  * #### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    Working in smaller and modular pieces is a tactic than I will apply in future work. Take one object and ensure that it is up to your standard before moving to the next object. The same logic or tactic can be applied to features. I first worked on creating an object, then the texture, then the camera movement, until I added the appropriate lighting for my 3D world.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs?
  * #### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    Using pre-exisiting libraries can makes your code more readable and maintainable, and it saves a lot of time. Having different header files that accomplish different tasks is also important in that it helps clear the clutter in the main function of your application.

  * #### How did iteration factor in your development?
    Iteration was crucial in how I learned OpenGL and in the development of my work. I started by creating a basic set of 2D triangles, then continued to create more complex objects and more features. Each week I built on the work and results of the previous week.
    
  * #### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project's completion?
    Instead of writing all the code and then rendering the program, I would make small changes, build, test, and continue to build if the testing was succesful. Because the code was complex, it was crucial I checked and rendered my world every change to ensure it was good enough for my liking.

### 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  * #### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    Visualizations make complex data more accessible. They allow you to understand patterns, trends, and relationships in data, which can be applied in fields such as data analysis, market research, and decision-making. Learning to code for visualizations can improve your programming skills, which are increasingly valuable in many professions, from web development to data science.
    
  * #### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    Proficiency in computational graphics can make me a more attractive canditate for jobs that require data analysis, research, or visualization skills, potentially leading to better career oppurtunities.
